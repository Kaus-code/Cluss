**Cluss** turns the chaos of YouTube tutorials into structured, achievable courses. We don't just show you videos; we build you a personalized schedule, give you an AI tutor, and help you track your journey from "Newbie" to "Master."

## 😫 The Problem
You find a great 10-hour playlist on "Full Stack Development." You watch 3 videos, get distracted, lose your place, and never finish. You have passive knowledge, but no real understanding.

## 🚀 The Cluss Solution
We wrap a powerful learning environment around the best content on the web.

### 1. 📅 Your Personal Study Planner
Stop guessing if you'll finish in time. We offer two modes to fit your life:
* **"I have a deadline!" (Exam Mode):** Tell us when your exam is. We calculate exactly how many videos you need to watch daily to finish on time. [cite_start]If it's impossible, we'll warn you! [cite: 42-47]
* **"I have a busy life." (Flex Mode):** Tell us you have 1 hour on Tuesdays and 4 hours on Sundays. [cite_start]We generate a custom calendar that fits *your* free time. [cite: 39-41]

### 2. 🤖 AI Teaching Assistant
Stuck on a concept? Don't scroll through comments. Use your daily credits to:
* **Deep Search:** Ask *"Where do they talk about For Loops?"* and jump straight to that second (e.g., 3:45). [cite: 55]
* **Instant Notes:** Get a neat PDF summary of the entire video in seconds. [cite: 57]
* **Quiz Yourself:** Generate practice questions to make sure you actually understood the lecture. [cite: 58]

### 3. 🤝 Infinite Context Study Rooms
Create a "Room" with friends. Upload your class notes, PDFs, or code. [cite_start]Our AI reads *everything* (even massive files) so you can ask questions across all your documents and videos at once. [cite: 63]

### 4. 🔥 Gamify Your Growth
* [cite_start]**Heatmap:** Fill your calendar with green squares (just like GitHub) by studying every day. [cite: 75]
* **Leaderboards:** Compete with friends for "Knowledge Points."
* **Streaks:** Don't break the chain!

## 💎 How It Works

1.  **Search:** Type in what you want to learn (e.g., "Data Structures").
2.  **Plan:** Choose a playlist and set your schedule.
3.  **Learn:** Watch, chat with the AI, take notes, and pass quizzes to unlock the next module.
4.  **Win:** Earn badges and track your progress on your dashboard.

## 🪙 Free vs. Premium

**Cluss operates on a Credit System.**
* **Free Plan:** You get a fresh batch of credits *every single day*. Perfect for casual learners. (Credits reset daily)[cite_start]. [cite: 68]
* **Premium Plan:** Get more daily credits, and they **roll over** if you don't use them. [cite_start]Plus, access to advanced AI models and unlimited Study Rooms. [cite: 68-69]
